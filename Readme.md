#  Resume

This is a little sample project demonstrating the use and interaction of 
- the Assisticant MVVM framework
- the Modern Charts UI
- Autofac IoC
- and the MahApps.Metro UI framework

This is work in progress and so currently not very useful.
At the moment GitHub is just a backup of my local repository.
